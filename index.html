<h1>The Struggles Of Being A Waiter/Server</h1>
<p>Good food, well blended wine or an aromatic grinded arabican coffee with freshly baked muffins,these are chief ingredients
that make you fall in love with restaurants,but of course accompanied by a well informed forever smiling server.These components
mixed together make up the forever fast growing industry of Food and Beverage also known as the F&B.<p>
<p>F&B has birthed and contributed a lot to the community and has met the daily needs of society as many of us hardly get time to cook a decent meal at home as we live in a fast paced and highly demanding economic times.
At a very young age,i got the priviledge to work in this phenominal industry as a server,my journey wasn't an easy one i must say but it was an exciting and educational one.The things i learnt,the experiences have all contributed to who i am as a person.<p>
<p>I started out as an ordinary runner,i used to do the odd jobs of cleaning,setting up tables and to follow what the head server required me to do,for i didn't know and was still in training.Everything was still new to me,watching patrons eating these beautiful and well plated and designed dishes it was as if  i had visited a  foreign land.I had to learn and study the menu as quick and as fast as i can if i was going to get the job.i mean i knew nothing about making conversations with strangers,interracting with them,nobody really teaches you these things but you had to learn as time passed by.<p>

<p>Finally i had grasped the menu and also had a few regular patrons who loved me,that earned me the spot of graduating to became a fully well trained server.I was really happy and proud of my self,little did i know that it also came with its own challenges.We had a policy at work whereby you pay for breakages,i was really puzzled by this as i hardly broke anything whether it be glasses or plates,i mean these deductions where done every single day.There was nothing i could do or say for i needed the job and if had opposed or refused i would be shown the door,this really made me uncomfortable but anyways rules are rules.I continued to work diligently,i even got used to standing long hours and hardly even got  a break or eat,this resulted to me losing weight,i was malnourished and very tired,i needed rest but the thought that if i didn't go to work i wouldn't get paid as i was trying to survive and be independent.I remember we used to drink red bulls to cope with fatigue until one day,i felt dizzy and i fell(fainted).I was rushed to the hospital and given a drip,hunger dehydration,fatigue you name it had taken over.
I took time off about a week two then decided to get back to work,to my shocking suprise my salary had been cut off,the company had implemented a new rule of getting paid through gratuity.Like basically i was going to work and get myself paid,reality had struck me,after all the hard work and dedication all these years down the drain.Most customers never really understood why it is important to pay the 10% gratuity.
I used to get angry when they didn't tip,fully known if they don't i would go to bed hungry or struggle to pay bills.I was depressed,i was anxious,i was nolonger happy and i became bitter.<p>
<p>I then decided to take a step back,quit  work and go back to my parents,and recuperate take care of myself and rethink about my future.Most people never understand what these servers and waiters go through in their daily lives,but still continue to smile and give exceptional service,remembering your favourite order or your regular
